# The Editors Friend

Are you a writer or editor who loves using Markdown for your writing work? Then you need the Editors Friend!

I am in the process of getting proper documentation together, but currently the plugin supports creating lists of words you want to search and replace in text and commands for inserting shortcodes.

It may not be too much use to you right now, but give it time!
